"""How wide a piece of text is when a fixed-cell renderer draws it.

In the core because a length constraint is meaningless unless every side measures it the
same way. A component that knows a field fits twenty columns and a producer that counts
characters will disagree the moment CJK is involved, and the disagreement is invisible until
text overflows in the running program.

Measured in half-width columns, the unit every fixed-cell renderer draws in: an ASCII glyph
occupies one, an East-Asian wide or full-width glyph two, and anything that draws no cell of
its own none. The width class is decided by :func:`unicodedata.east_asian_width`, which
covers the whole of Unicode — including the supplementary-plane CJK extensions a hand-rolled
range list silently misses, exactly where a rare or historical ideograph in a name would
otherwise slip past a hard width budget.

The model is deliberately *context-free*: each character costs the same wherever it appears,
so width is additive over concatenation. See :func:`display_columns` for what that buys, and
for the one rendering effect it cannot express.

A decomposed Korean syllable is L + V (+ T): the leading consonant carries the syllable's

letters (category ``Lo``) with canonical combining class 0, so no general mark test sees
them, and NFD Korean measured DOUBLE its rendered width -- NFD ``'한'`` came to 4 columns
against NFC's 2, so a corpus arriving NFD was rejected wholesale as over-length.

The ranges cover the vowels (V) and trailing consonants (T) only: U+1160-U+11FF from the base
block, and U+D7B0-U+D7FF from Extended-B. The leading consonants -- U+1100-U+115F and

    Marks, format characters and composing Hangul jamo add nothing (they render into a
    neighbouring cell, or nothing at all); East-Asian wide and full-width characters count
    two; everything else, including East-Asian *ambiguous*, counts one -- the conservative
    reading for a non-CJK terminal.

    Because every character's cost is fixed, the total is additive:
    ``display_columns(a + b) == display_columns(a) + display_columns(b)`` for all strings.
    Callers may therefore measure a payload in pieces and add up, and a remaining budget can be
    tracked incrementally.

    KNOWN OVER-COUNT, deliberately not fixed: a sequence joined by ZWJ renders as one grapheme
    but is measured per code point. The family emoji ``U+1F468 ZWJ U+1F469 ZWJ U+1F466`` costs
    6 here (the joiners are free, the three pictographs are wide) against roughly 2 as drawn.
    Fixing it needs grapheme-cluster segmentation, which the standard library does not provide
    and which no available approximation makes safe:

    * A targeted "a character preceded by ZWJ is free" rule does give 2 for the family emoji,
      but ZWJ is not emoji-specific -- it also requests a joining form in Arabic and a conjunct
      in Indic scripts, and between ordinary letters it is simply ignored by the shaper. There
      the rule *under*-counts, without limit: ``a ZWJ b ZWJ c`` measures 1 and draws 3. An
      under-count is the worse failure for a budget whose job is to prevent overflow, and it
      makes the budget evadable by interleaving invisible characters.
    * It also breaks additivity for every caller, in exchange for a partial answer: skin tone
      modifiers, keycaps and regional-indicator flags would still be counted per code point.

    So the model stays context-free and honestly over-counts ZWJ sequences, rather than
    degrading silently on text that merely looks similar. Emoji-dense payloads under a tight
    column budget are the case to revisit this for, with a real segmentation library.
