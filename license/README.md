# Licensing

This project is **source-available and dual-licensed**.

## 1. Noncommercial license (free)

For any **noncommercial** purpose — personal projects, study, teaching, academic
research, evaluation — the software is free to use, modify, and distribute under the
**PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0**, in [`LICENSE.md`](./LICENSE.md).

"Noncommercial" is defined in that license. In short: use without an anticipated
commercial application, and use by educational, research, charitable, and government
institutions, is permitted. Everything the license permits, it permits for free.

## 2. Commercial license (paid)

Any **commercial** use — including use inside a for-profit product or service, or by a
company for its business — is **not** granted by the noncommercial license and requires
a separate, paid commercial license from the copyright holder.

To arrange one, contact the licensor:

> **Jakub Grzana** — <meronentertainment@gmail.com>

The commercial license terms are whatever you and the licensor agree; the file in this
directory governs only the noncommercial grant.

## Third-party dependencies and models

None are bundled into this repository — Python packages are installed from PyPI at setup
time, and model files and recipe datasets are fetched on demand by scripts, never
committed. Every runtime dependency is permissively licensed, so none constrains the
licensing above. Default model choices are kept commercially clean (Apache-2.0 / MIT), and
the datasets each recipe fetches carry their own licenses, which govern *your* use of that
data rather than this software. The full list, with licenses, is in
[`THIRD-PARTY.md`](./THIRD-PARTY.md).
